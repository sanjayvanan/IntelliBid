# INTELLIBID KNOWLEDGE BASE

## 1. GETTING STARTED
### What is IntelliBid?
IntelliBid is a smart auction platform powered by AI. We use advanced machine learning to help you value items, write descriptions, and find the best deals.

### How do I create an account?

## 2. BUYING & BIDDING
### How do I place a bid?
Go to any active auction page. Enter your **maximum bid** amount in the bidding box.

### What is "Proxy Bidding"?
Our system uses **Proxy Bidding** (also known as automatic bidding). 
- You enter the *maximum* amount you are willing to pay (e.g., $100).
- The system will only bid the *minimum* amount needed to keep you in the lead (e.g., $55).
- If someone else bids $60, the system instantly bids $61 for you.
- We stop bidding for you only when the price exceeds your maximum limit ($100).

### Can I cancel a bid?
No. All bids are binding contracts. Please bid carefully.

### How do I know if I won?
If you are the highest bidder when the timer hits zero:
1. You will receive an **email notification**.
2. The item will appear in your **Profile** under "Auctions Won".

## 3. SELLING ITEMS
### How do I list an item?
1. Click **"Add Item"** in the navigation bar.
2. Enter the **Item Name** and select a **Category**.
3. Use our **AI Tools** (detailed below) to fill in the rest instantly.
4. Upload clear photos and set your **Start Price** and **End Time**.
5. Click **"Launch Auction"**.

### What are the AI Tools for sellers?
We offer three powerful AI features to help you sell faster:
1.  **Smart Attributes (Auto-Detect):** Click this to automatically find technical specs for your item (e.g., if you sell an iPhone, it detects fields for Storage, Battery Health, and Color).
2.  **Auto-Write Description:** Enter a name, and our AI will write a professional, persuasive sales pitch for you.
3.  **AI Market Appraiser:** Before you list, click "Analyze". We compare your draft against real sold history to give you a **Deal Score (1-10)** and a price estimate.

### Can I edit my listing?
You can only edit a listing **before** the first bid is placed. Once bidding starts, the listing is locked to ensure fairness.

## 4. PAYMENTS & SHIPPING
### How do I pay for an item I won?
Go to your **Profile** page. Under "Auctions Won", you will see a **"Pay Now"** button next to unpaid items. We use **Razorpay** for secure transactions (Cards, UPI, Netbanking).

### Is shipping included?
Shipping terms are set by the seller in the description. Please read the description carefully before bidding.

### What happens if a buyer doesn't pay?
Buyers must pay within 24 hours. If they fail to pay, the item may be offered to the second-highest bidder or relisted, and the non-paying buyer's account may be suspended.

## 5. TECHNICAL ISSUES
### The auction timer ended but I didn't win?
Auctions close precisely at the end time. If a bid is placed in the last few seconds, the auction does *not* extend (unless "Soft Close" is active, which is currently disabled). The highest confirmed bid at 00:00 wins.

### Why was my listing rejected?
We do not allow illegal items, weapons, hazardous materials, or counterfeit goods. If your item falls into these categories, it will be removed.
